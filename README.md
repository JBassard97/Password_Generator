# Password Generator
## Description
This repository contains the completed code for a Password Generator application! This app will ask the user various criteria about the password, and through JavaScript logic will give you a desirable result. 
## Features
This project was quite frankly my first real dive into JavaScript, and uses the inputs given with window.prompt() and window.confirm() to manipulate arrays under the hood. Other methods I used are to concatenanate arrays, convert them to a string, and removing space/commas so the final password given is clean and usable! I also recommend watching along in the browser's console, as I've made it fun to watch the arrays grow with each user choice.  
## Usage
When loading the page, you're presented with a styled box with some placeholder text in the center. Upon pressing the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts will ask the user the following criteria:
1. Password length
2. Including lowercase characters
3. Including uppercase characters
4. Including numbers
5. Including special characters

Once all the prompts are complete, your new password will display where the placeholder text "Your Secure Password" once was!
